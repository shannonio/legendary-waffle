## Photo Gallery Rails

An incomplete photo gallery

The following tools and libraries are preinstalled for you:

- Ruby on Rails
- Faraday
- RSpec
- A simple [Picsum Photos API](https://picsum.photos) Client

## Desired Features

### Image Preview

- Fetch 30 images and render each image in the Gallery so it includes the image and the author name

### Image Detailed View

- When a user clicks on an image, they should be taken to a detail view for that image which includes extended information such as `width`, `height`, `url` and `download_url`

### (Bonus) Image Search

- Implement a search box at the top of the Gallery
- As a user types, the list of images in the Gallery should filter based on the matching author name
